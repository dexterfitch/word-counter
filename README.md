Word Counter!
by Dex Fitch

Word Counter! is a simple app written with Ruby and dressed for the public with Sinatra. It's designed to take in a user-determined string of words, and then sift through that string to check for how many instances another user-determined word appears. It's sort of just taking the hay out of the haystack while you needle-search.
