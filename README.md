Word Counter!

by Dex Fitch


ABOUT

Word Counter! is a simple app written with Ruby and dressed for the public with Sinatra. It's designed to take in a user-determined string of words, and then sift through that string to check for how many instances another user-determined word appears. It's sort of just taking the hay out of the haystack while you needle-search.


SETUP

To use Word Counter!, download all of the project files to your machine and, assuming you already have Ruby and Sinatra installed, run 'ruby app.rb' in your terminal, and then navigate to 'localhost:4567' - it should take care of itself, from there! If you need help with getting Ruby and Sinatra going, check out the guides at http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com.
